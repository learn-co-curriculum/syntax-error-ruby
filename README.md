Syntax error pretty common, even for experienced developers, so it's important that you learn how to find and fix them.

## Objectives

The file `syntax_error.rb` has, you guessed it, one or many syntax errors. Your task is to fix them.

## Instructions

1. Run your test suite to verify that there are syntax errors. 
2. Look at the file `syntax_error.rb`. Do you see any errors?
